## 🔄 PATTERN FOR REMAINING PHASES

Each phase follows the same pattern:
- **🌍 Countries** = Major feature areas (3-4 per phase)
- **🏛️ States** = Specific implementation tasks (1-3 per country)
- **📝 Prompts** = Individual AI tasks (max 5 tasks each)

## 📋 PROMPT VERIFICATION SYSTEM

Each prompt will include:
```
✅ VERIFY PREVIOUS WORK:
1. [Previous feature] is working correctly
2. [Database changes] are applied properly
3. [Components] are functional and tested
4. [Integration] works as expected

🎯 BUILD [CURRENT FEATURE]:
[Max 5 specific tasks]

🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
[What to test to confirm completion]
```

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Choose Phase**: Which phase would you like detailed prompts for?
2. **Customize**: Any specific requirements or changes?
3. **Generate Prompts**: Create individual AI prompts for each state
4. **Execute**: Run prompts one by one, verifying each completion
